# Playbook with CAVATICA User Guide

[CAVATICA](https://www.cavatica.org/) is a data analysis and sharing platform designed to accelerate discovery in a scalable, cloud-based compute environment where data, results, and workflows are shared among the world's research community. Developed by Seven Bridges and funded in-part by a grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Common Fund, CAVATICA is continuously updated with new tools and datasets.

CAVATICA offers secure storage and compute in a cloud environment, though integration with CAVATICA is still preliminary, your CAVATICA account can be used for operating the playbook using your own private computation and storage. Once configured and activated, you'll be able to use the playbook the same way as you do with the public compute resources, but all information will be processed and persisted by a worker launched in your CAVATICA account, and all persisted data files will remain in your CAVATICA workspace.
